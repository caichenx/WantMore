// ******** Ideas to build the website ************
/* 
1. business name: vince & kath
2. navigation bar: marketplace, search, cart, account
3. components: SearchBar, Navigation, Marketplace, ItemCards, Carts
*/

// ******** What you learned from this project ************
/*
1. correct modification of state arrays in ReactJS
2. components will mount or unmount when clicking different tabs on navigation bar
3. map() function will create a NEW ARRAY with the results of calling a function for every array element (e.g. removeFromCart)
4. 


*/

// ******** QUESTIONS ***********

*/
